Objetive: Analyze which x-variable would wield the most significant influence on a student's grades. 
Real World Use: These results would help students in the class as we are able to predict the studentâ€™s final grade and, more importantly, assist students who are at risk of failing the course. With the use of predictive analytics, we are able to construct a model capable of forecasting academic challenges. Our goal is to allow teachers to offer assistance to students before they are at risk of failing, fostering an environment where every student can succeed.
